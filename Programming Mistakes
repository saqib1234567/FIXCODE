 1: Undeclared Variables:

int main()
{
cin>>x;
cout<<x;
}

"Huh? Why do I get an error?"
 

2: Uninitialized variables:

int count;
while(count<100)
{
cout<<count;
}

"Why doesn't my program enter the while loop?"


3: Setting a variable to an uninitialized value:

int a, b;
int sum=a+b;
cout<<"Enter two numbers to add: ";
cin>>b;
cout<<"The sum is: "<<sum;
When Run:
Enter two numbers to add: 1 3
The sum is: -1393

"What's wrong with my program?"


4: Using a single equal sign to check equality:

char x='Y';
while(x='Y')
{
//...
cout<<"Continue? (Y/N)";
cin>>x;
}

"Why doesn't my loop ever end?"
 

5: Undeclared Functions:

int main()
{
menu();
}
void menu()
{
//...
}

"Why do I get an error about menu being unknown?"

6: Extra Semicolons:

for(int x=0; x<100; x++);
cout<<x;

"Why does it output 100?"

7: Overstepping array boundaries:

int array[10];
//...
for(int x=1; x<=10; x++)
cout<<array[x];

"Why doesn't it output the correct values?"


8: Integer division

For example:
double half = 1/2;

This code sets half to 0 not 0.5! Why? Because 1 and 2 are integer constants.


9: Variable Name Styles

Take a look at the below program. Can you see anything wrong?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

main()
{
char CatName[20] = "fluffy";
char dogName[20] = "fido";
char rat_Name[20] = "fester";
int Catage = 3;
int dogs_age = 4;
int ratage = 1;
char myPet[20];
int itsAge;

strcpy(myPet,rat_Name);
itsAge = ratage;
printf("My pet is %s\n",myPet);
}

Besides the obviously bizarre choice of having a pet rat, do you notice anything? Take a close look at the variable names. There is no consistent style. Is the variable that stores good old Fido's name dogName, DogName, dog_name, dogname or Dogname? A programmer writing this code would need to constantly check to get the variable name correct. Do yourself a favor and simplify you life. Choose a consistent style for variable names and stick to it. The exact style doesn't matter but consistency does. You'll be amazed at how much faster you can develop code and how many fewer compiler errors you will get if you adopt a consistent style.

10 Misusing the && and || operators:

int value;
do
{
//...
value=10;
}while(!(value==10) || !(value==20))

"Huh? Even though value is 10 the program loops. Why?"
